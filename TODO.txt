# Generation
* Do not separate points that are already excluded by previous separator
  i.e., remove redundant separators (only when reset)
* Separate safe with margin (easy: just compute distance of safe face with
  inside and image points)
# Verification
* Maximize margin outside for contraction verifier (then: is counterexample only
  if margin > 0)
